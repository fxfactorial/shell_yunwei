<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>Unfortunately although there are several good online tutorials 
available for C and C++ none of the authors responded to my 
request for permission to use their tutors on the CD. Rather than 
providing no sources of information I have compiled the 
following list of links to some of the best sites. You will obviously 
require an internet connection to access these sites.</P>

<P>A comprehensive list of C/C++ resources, including all of the 
tutors listed here (and more) can be found at:</P>

This tutorial contains a complete course for you to learn C. 
It is geared towards the UNIX operating system, but most can be applied
regardless of platform.

<LI>Title: Programming in C <BR>
Author: Dave Marshall <BR>

This is one of the best C programming tutorials out there on the
World Wide Web (WWW) and one of those that I tried to get permission 
to put on the CD.

<LI>Title: COMP.LANG.C FAQ <BR>
Author: Steve Summit <BR>

The FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) is a compilation of
frequently asked questions along with the answers. It is not a tutor 
per se but will answer many of the questions raised by C programmers 
and is well worth reading if you want to program in C. 
(The FAQ for any programming language is worth reading come to that!)

Title: C++ Annotations (ver 3.3.3)<BR> 
Author: Frank Brokken & Karel Kubat <BR>

This tutorial assumes you are knowledgeable in C so you need to do 
one of the other tutors first. This is not a bad thing since C++ is 
an evolution of C and it's difficult to understand some C++ concepts 
without knowing the historical background.<BR>

<LI>Title: COMP.LANG.C++ FAQ <BR>
Author: Marshall P. Cline, PH.D. <BR>

Like the C FAQ earlier this is a great source of answers to questions. 
It's not a tutor but is a great source of information about some of 
the more confusing aspects of C++. An extended version is available 
in book form from Addison Wesley.
