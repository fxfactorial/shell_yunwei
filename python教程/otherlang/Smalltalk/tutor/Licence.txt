Dolphin Smalltalk Development License

BY CLICKING ON THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY, AND ARE BECOMING A 
PARTY, TO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT CLICK 
THE "DO NOT ACCEPT" BUTTON AND DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE.

LICENSE IN A NUTSHELL.

The full license agreement follows. This paragraph contains the “spirit” of the agreement in an easy to read summary 
and is provided as a convenience to you. It does not form part of the agreement itself.

By agreeing to this license you are entitled to install and use Dolphin Smalltalk on any number of computers. You can 
use it to learn about, and develop software in, the Smalltalk language. You can distribute the software you create to 
others in source form only. You are not allowed to create and distribute executables or binary versions of your classes. 
Object Arts has separate products that may be purchased to grant these additional rights.

You may give copies of Dolphin to whomever you like but only in the form of the original installation program. We 
would like all users to register their copies of the product. Once again, you can contact Object Arts for additional rights 
if, for example you are a school and you want to equip your students without the need for each to register separately.

The full text of the license agreement follows and is available in the file, ‘License.rtf’ in the installation directory.
